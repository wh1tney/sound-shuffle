# SoundShuffle

Listen to a shuffled mix of your favorite sounds from SoundCloud!

###Why is this useful?
Like Twitter, SoundCloud resources are posted linearly. If you are an active SoundCloud user, that amazing Little Dragon track you reposted on Wednesday is at the bottom of your profile by Friday. Bring back the vibes by shuffling your favorite sounds with SoundShuffle.

Happy listening.
